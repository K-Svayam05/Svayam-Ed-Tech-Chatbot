- Learning Style: {user_context.get('learning_style', 'Not specified')}

QUESTION: {query}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. **Personalize the response** based on the user's education level and age:
   - For primary students (ages 5-10): Use simple language, relate to everyday experiences, use stories and analogies they would understand
   - For secondary students (ages 11-16): Use more detailed explanations but still accessible, relate to their school subjects
   - For higher secondary/college: Use more advanced concepts and academic language

2. **Structure your response** with clear formatting:
   - Use markdown formatting with ## for main headings and ### for subheadings
   - Use bullet points (â€¢) for lists
   - Use **bold** for important terms
   - Include examples relevant to their age group
   - Break down complex concepts into simple steps

3. **Make it relatable**:
   - Connect concepts to things they know from their age/education level
   - Use examples from their daily life or previous studies
   - If they're from a specific country, use relevant cultural references when appropriate

4. **Keep it engaging**:
   - Ask follow-up questions to encourage learning
   - Provide practical applications they can understand
   - Use analogies appropriate for their age group

Please provide a clear, educational response that follows these guidelines.
